        <header class="section-header">What is HTML</header>
        <p><strong>HTML</strong> (<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of <strong>elements</strong>, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing <strong>tags</strong> can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
          <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        </p>
        <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (<span class="tag">&ltp&gt</span>) element:
          <code>&lt<span>p</span>&gtMy cat is very grumpy&lt/<span>p</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Prerequisites">
        <header class="section-header">Prerequisites</header>
        <p>Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up and understand how to create and manage files.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
        <header class="section-header">Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the first section:</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="grumpy-cat-small" />
        <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
        <ul class="ul-main-doc">
          <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of theelement (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
          <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
          <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
        <header class="section-header">Nesting elements</header>
        <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <span class="tag">&ltp&gt</span> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) to formatting:
          <code>&lt<span>p</span>&gtMy cat is &lt<span>strong</span>&gtvery&lt/<span>strong</span>&gtgrumpy.&lt/<span>p</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <span class="element">p</span> element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the <span\ class="element">p</span>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Block_versus_inline_elements">
        <header class="section-header">Block versus inline elements</header>
        <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
        <ul class="ul-main-doc">
          <li><strong>Block-level elements</strong> form a visible block on apage. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
          <li><strong>Inline elements</strong> are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <span class="tag">&lta&gt</span> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <span class="tag">&ltem&gt</span> or <span class="tag">&ltstrong&gt</span>create emphasis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider the following example:
          <code>&lt<span>em</span>&gtfirst&lt/<span>em</span>&gt&lt<span>em</span>&gtsecond&lt/<span>em</span>&gt&lt<span>em</span>&gtthird&lt/<span>em</span>&gt<br /><br />
          &lt<span>p</span>&gtfourth&lt/<span>p</span>&gt<br />
          &lt<span>p</span>&gtfifth&lt/<span>p</span>&gt<br />
          &lt<span>p</span>&gtsixth&lt/<span>p</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p><span class="tag">&ltem&gt</span> is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in between. On the other hand <span class="tag">&ltp&gt</span> is a block-level element. Each <span class="element">p</span> element appears on a new line, with space above and below.
          <code><i>firstsecondthird</i><br />fourth<br />fifth<br />sixth</code>
        </p>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Void_elements">
        <header class="section-header">Void elements</header>
        <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called <strong>void elements</strong>. For example, the <span class="tag">&ltimg&gt</span> element embeds an image file onto a page:
          <code>&lt<span>img</span><span class="attribute">src</span>="<span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png</span>"<span class="attribute">alt</span>="<span>Firefox icon</span>" /&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p>This would output the following:
          <img id="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" />
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header class="section-header">Attributes</header>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="grumpy-cat-attribute-small" />
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <span class="element">class</span> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ul class="ul-main-doc">
          <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document">
        <header class="section-header">Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
        <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
        <code class="pre"><pre>
&lt<span class="doctype">!DOCTYPE html</span>&gt
&lt<span>html</span> <span class="attribute">lang</span>="<span>en-US</span>"&gt
  &lt<span>head</span>&gt
    &lt<span>meta</span> <span class="attribute">charset</span>="<span>utf-8</span>" /&gt
    &lt<span>title</span>&gtMy test page&lt/<span>title</span>&gt
  &lt/<span>head</span>&gt
  &lt<span>body</span>&gt
    &lt<span>p</span>&gtThis is my page&lt/<span>p</span>&gt
  &lt/<span>body</span>&gt
&lt/<span>html</span>&gt</pre></code>
        <p>Here we have:</p>
        <ol class="ul-main-doc">
          <li><span class="tag">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</span>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:
            <code>&lt!<span class="doctype">DOCTYPE html PUBLIC</span> <span>"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"</span>&gt</code>More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right.<span class="tag">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</span> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!
          </li>
          <li><span class="tag">&lthtml&gt&lt/html&gt</span>: The <span class="tag">&lthtml&gt</span> element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
          <li><span class="tag">&lthead&gt&lt/head&gt</span>: The <span class="tag">&lthead&gt</span> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewer. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.</li>
          <li><span class="tag">&ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt</span>: The <span class="tag">&ltmeta&gt</span> element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <span class="tag">&ltbase&gt</span>, <span class="tag">&ltlink&gt</span>, <span class="tag">&ltscript&gt</span>, <span class="tag">&ltstyle&gt</span> or <span class="tag">&lttitle&gt</span>. The charset attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
          <li><span class="tag">&lttitle&gt&lt/title&gt</span>: The <span class="tag">&lttitle&gt</span> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
          <li><span class="tag">&ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt</span>: The <span class="tag">&ltbody&gt</span> element. This contains all the content this displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Headings_and_paragraphs">
        <header class="section-header">Headings and paragraphs</header>
        <p>Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/newspaper_small.jpg" alt="newspaper_small" />
        <p>Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <span class="tag">&ltp&gt</span> element, like so:
          <code>&lt<span>p</span>&gtI am a paragraph, oh yes I am.&lt/<span>p</span>&gt </code>
        </p>
        <p>Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:
          <code>&lt<span>h1</span>&gtI am the title of the story.&lt/<span>h1</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p>There are six heading elements: <span class="element">h1</span>, <span class="element">h2</span>, <span class="element">h3</span>, <span class="element">h4</span>, <span class="element">h5</span>, and <span class="element">h6</span>. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <span class="tag">&lth1&gt</span> represents the main heading, <span class="tag">&lth2&gt</span> represents subheadings, <span class="tag">&lth3&gt</span> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Unordered_lists">
        <header class="section-header">Unordered lists</header>
        <p>Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter. Let's take a shopping list as an example:
          <code>milk<br />eggs<br />bread<br />hummus</code>
        </p>
        <p>Every unordered list starts off with a <span class="tag">&ltul&gt</span> element—this wraps around all the list items:
          <code>&lt<span>ul</span>&gt<br />milk<br />eggs<br />bread<br />hummus<br />&lt<span>ul</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p>The last step is to wrap each list item in a <span class="tag">&ltli&gt</span> (list item) element:</p>
        <code class="pre"><pre>
&lt<span>ul</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtmilk&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gteggs&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtbread&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gthummus&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
&lt/<span>ul</span>&gt</pre></code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Ordered_lists">
        <header class="section-header">Ordered lists</header>
        <p>Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. Let's take a set of directions as an example:</p>
        <code class="pre"><pre>
1.Drive to the end of the road
2.Turn right
3.Go straight across the first two roundabouts
4.Turn left at the third roundabout
5.The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</pre></code>
        <p>The markup structure is the same as for unordered lists, except that you have to wrap the list items in an <span class="tag">&ltol&gt</span> element, rather than <span class="tag">&ltul&gt</span>:</p>
        <code class="pre"><pre>
&lt<span>ol</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtDrive to the end of the road&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtTurn right&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtGo straight across the first two roundabouts&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtTurn left at the third roundabout&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtThe school is on your right, 300 meters up the road&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
&lt/<span>ol</span>&gt</pre></code>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_lists">
        <header class="section-header">Nesting lists</header>
        <p>It is perfectly OK to nest one list inside another one. You might want to have some sub-bullets sitting below a top-level bullet. Let's take the second list from our recipe example:</p>
        <code class="pre"><pre>
&lt<span>ol</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtRemove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &ltli&gtRemove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &ltli&gtAdd all the ingredients into a food processor.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtProcess all the ingredients into a paste.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtIf you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt 
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtIf you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
&lt/<span>ol</span>&gt</pre></code>
        <p>Since the last two bullets are very closely related to the one before them (they read like sub-instructions or choices that fit below that bullet), it might make sense to nest them inside their own unordered list and put that list inside the current fourth bullet. This would look like so:</p>
        <code class="pre"><pre>
&lt<span>ol</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtRemove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtRemove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gtAdd all the ingredients into a food processor.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
  &lt<span>li</span>&gt
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    &lt<span>ul</span>&gt
      &lt<span>li</span>&gt
        If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
      &lt/<span>li</span>&gt
        &lt<span>li</span>&gtIf you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.&lt/<span>li</span>&gt
    &lt/<span>ul</span>&gt
  &lt/<span>li</span>&gt
&lt/<span>ol</span>&gt</pre></code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Emphasis_and_importance">
        <header class="section-header">Emphasis and importance</header>
        <p>When we want to add emphasis in spoken language, we stress certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying. Similarly, in written language we tend to stress words by putting them in italics. For example, the following two sentences have different meanings.
          <code>I am glad you weren't late.<br />
          I am <i>glad</i> you weren't <i>late</i></code>
        </p>
        <p>The first sentence sounds genuinely relieved that the person wasn't late. In contrast, the second one, with both the words "glad" and "late" in italics, sounds sarcastic or passive-aggressive, expressing annoyance that the person arrived a bit late.</p>
        <p>In HTML we use the <span class="tag">&ltem&gt</span> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as italic by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get italic styling. To do that, you'd use a <span class="tag">&ltspan&gt</span> element and some CSS, or perhaps an <span class="tag">&lti&gt</span> element.
          <code>&lt<span>p</span>&gtI am &lt<span>em</span>&gtglad&lt/<span>em</span>&gt you weren't &lt<span>em</span>&gtlate&lt/<span>em</span>&gt.&lt/<span>p</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p>To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in spoken language and bold them in written language. For example:
          <code>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.<br />
          I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</code>
        </p>
        <p>In HTML we use the <span class="tag">&ltstrong&gt</span> (strong importance) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as bold text by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get bold styling. To do that, you'd use a <span class="tag">&ltspan&gt</span> element and some CSS, or perhaps a <span class="tag">&ltp&gt</span> element.
          <code>&lt<span>p</span>&gtThis liquid is &lt<span>strong</span>&gthighly toxic&lt/<span>strong</span>&gt.&lt/<span>p</span>&gt<br />
          &lt<span>p</span>&gtI am counting on you. &lt<span>strong</span>&gtDo not&lt/<span>strong</span>&gt be
          late!&lt/<span>p</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
        <p>You can nest strong and emphasis inside one another if desired:
          <code>&lt<span>p</span>&gtThis liquid is &lt<span>strong</span>&gthighly toxic&lt/<span>strong</span>&gt —<br /> if you drink it, &lt<span>strong</span>&gtyou may &lt<span>em</span>&gtdie&lt/<span>em</span>&gt&lt/<span>strong</span>&gt.&lt/<span>p</span>&gt</code>
        </p>
